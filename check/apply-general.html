              <h2 class="font-weight-bold">E-mail Communication</h2>
              <p>E-mail is one of the official means of communication between LIUS and its students. All students are
                assigned a LIUS e-mail address upon course registration. The e-mail address assigned to a student by the
                University will be the
                only e-mail address used by LIUS for communication with students for academic and administrative
                purposes. Students are
                responsible for checking their LIUS e-mail account regularly so as to remain current with administrative
                and academic
                notifications. It is the student's responsibility to ensure that time- critical e-mail is accessed,
                read, and acted upon in a timely
                fashion. If a student chooses to forward University e-mail to another e-mail address, it is the

                  your application.
                  Have you taken on new challenges outside the classroom? Have you contributed to your school and
                  community?
                  If so, we are excited to read your application.</p>

                <p>LIUS seeks to admit the best possible domestic and international students on the basis of academic
                  performance and potential, and will select applicants for admission based on
                  competitive strength. LIUS will consider high school applicants‟ achievement on all courses taken in
                  grades 11 and 12 in the admissions process. All applicants to LIUS must meet the minimum requirements
                  for admission consideration including:</p>

                  <li>Admission average as calculated by LIUS.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>LIUS may also consider other aspects of an applicant‟s complete academic record in rendering an
                  admission decision including, but not limited to:</p>
                <ul class="list-marked list offset-top-10">
                  <li>Attendance at multiple high schools where there are distinctly different patterns of performance,
                  </li>
                  <li>The number of times courses have been attempted and the associated pattern of achievement,</li>
                  <li>Breadth, rigor and relevance of high school courses</li>
                  <li>The relative strength of any required test scores.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Where these issues are identified, applicants will be given an opportunity to provide additional
                  supplementary information before an admissions decision is made. LIUS is committed to achieving
                  diversity within our student population This includes ensuring our international student body
                  represents a wide range of regions and countries, so that we reflect the many and varied viewpoints
                  that all of our students bring to the classroom.</p>

                <h3>Home School</h3>
                <p>Homeschooled Applicant Assessment Criteria include:</p>
                <ul class="list-marked list offset-top-10">
                  <li>If your school is recognized by the Ministry of Education of your country and is following the
                    national curriculum please follow the requirements under admissions

                </ul>

                <p>Admission is competitive and enrollment is limited. At LIUS, homeschooled applicants are evaluated
                  for admission on an individual basis. In order to make a knowledgeable assessment, LIUS requires the
                  following documents and supplementary materials:</p>
                <ol class="list list-ordered text-left">
                  <li><span><b>Transcript of grades</b> indicating all subjects taken and grades earned from grades 10
                      through 12. These may be graded either by an independent homeschool agency or by the applicant‟s
                      parent(s). The transcript should indicate the name of each course or subject covered, the grade
                      received in each course, and the duration of the course including the number of hours and
                      weeks.</span></li>
                  <li><span><b>Standardized Testing Results</b> (such as SAT Reasoning Test, SAT Subject Tests, ACT, AP
                      Exams, etc.) sent directly to LIUS from the examining board.</span></li>

                        the Tree of Life. In your letter, you should also include the length of homeschool study and why
                        you and your parents decided to homeschool. In addition, it would be helpful to include your

                      <li>Brief course descriptions and syllabi of the courses you have studied with a list of texts

                </ol>
                <p>Once you apply, you will be required to upload the required documentation and submit exactly as they
                  are requested. Documents submitted in any other way will not be accepted.</p>

                <h3>Applicants Possessing an Undergraduate Degree</h3>
                <p>Applicants who have already graduated with an undergraduate degree are referred to as Special
                  Students. You will be considered for admission as a Special Students if you have a degree from an
                  accredited university that is equivalent to at least a 3 year Bachelor‟s Degree at LIUS and if you
                  have achieved a minimum overall average of 60% in the context of LIUS‟ grading system.</p>
                <p>Admission to an undergraduate program does not imply acceptance into a graduate program. Special
                  Students who applied for graduate studies at LIUS, who were not admitted and were
                  recommended to take some undergraduate courses in order to improve their application for graduate
                  studies, are not guaranteed admission to an undergraduate program or course(s) at LIUS. These students
                  must follow the same application procedures and meet the same admission requirements as other
                  undergraduate applicants.</p>
                <p>Students are not eligible to graduate with a degree from LIUS for a subject in which they have
                  already earned a degree. For example, an individual who applies to LIUS who already holds a degree in
                  biology from any university will not be eligible to graduate with a second degree in biology from
                  LIUS. However, he or she may be eligible to enroll in biology courses at LIUS for the purposes of
                  upgrading or supplementing previous education.</p>
                <p>** LIUS reserves the right to cancel your application, withdraw a final offer of admission or revoke
                  registration if there is a discrepancy between the documents originally submitted and the official
                  final (updated) results submitted to WES for authentication and verification.</p>

            </div>

            <p>Admission into first-year programs at LIUS is limited and competitive. Mature Students are normally
              considered for part-time admission (i.e. a maximum of three full courses between September and April).
              However, full-time enrollment may be necessary when preparing for admission to professional programs such
              as Dentistry and Medicine.
            </p>
            <p>If you are applying for full-time admission, you must submit a Mature Applicant
              Supplementary Form indicating why you feel you may be successful in university studies; what you wish to
              gain from the experience; and why full-time admission is necessary. You should include information
              relevant to your academic goals, career ambitions or plans, and past work experience. Part-time applicants
              may also be required to submit similar documentation in support of their applications.</p>

            <p>Applicants who are 60 years of age may be considered for admission as a Senior Citizen. Students admitted
              as a Senior Citizen may register in an undergraduate program on a full-time or part-time basis. Those
              seeking admission to faculties other than Arts, Science, or Social Science may be required to provide

            <h3>English Proficiency Requirements</h3>
            <p>At LIUS, admission consideration is based on academic qualifications along with evidence of English
              proficiency for those applicants whose first language is not English. You must therefore submit proof of
              English language proficiency before being considered for
              admission.

            <p>LIUS is an English language university and it is important to your success at LIUS that you are
              proficient in both spoken and written English. All students must demonstrate the ability to speak and
              write clearly and correctly. To encourage aptitude in the use of the English language, LIUS‟ instructors
              consider proficiency in English when assigning grades. Work presented in English in any subject, at any
              level, which shows a lack of proficiency in English may either be failed or, at the discretion of the
              instructor, returned to the student for revision to a literate level.</p>
