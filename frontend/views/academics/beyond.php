                            difficult to balance your classes with your social life. As a returning or
                            upper-year student, you might be concerned with how to talk to your professors,
                            handle bigger expectations, or change programs. Our student advisor can discuss
                            these issues with you, and we encourage you to contact us if you are considering
                            withdrawing or worried that you are not fitting in. We can also help you improve
                            your skills so you can:</p>
