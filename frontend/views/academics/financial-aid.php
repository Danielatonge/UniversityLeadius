                        <p>Each year, we anticipate that a fairly small and highly qualified group of
                            international students will be offered financial aid. Because LIUS relies on
                            federally-subsidized funds for which international students do not qualify, the
                            university must draw on limited institutional resources (primarily grants) when
                            aiding international students. While competition for international student financial
                            aid is strong, the university is committed to maintaining and expanding its global
                            campus community.</p>

                        <h4>Important Policies</h4>
                        <p>The university awards financial aid only on the basis of demonstrated financial need
                            and merit- based academic scholarships.</p>
                        <p>Financial aid is not available to international students who do not receive aid upon
                            admission. The family contribution that is determined upon admission will remain the
                            same as long as the student is eligible to receive financial aid.</p>
                        <p>With its global outlook and location in a proudly multicultural city, LIUS offers a
                            warm welcome to international students. Citizens of more than 130 countries comprise
                            22.6 percent of the university4s student body.</p>

                        <h4>Merit Scholarships</h4>
                        <p>To recognize applicants for their outstanding academic and extracurricular
                            achievement, demonstrated leadership, and commitment to their communities, we offer
                            merit scholarships to international applicants. Merit scholarships are
                            partial-tuition scholarships that may be a single lump-sum award, or a renewable
                            annual award. We also offer scholarship of 60 %, 70%, 80 %, and 90% depending on the
                            student’s profile. Merit scholarships are considered independently of an applicant’s
                            financial situation, so if an applicant thinks he or she may require financial
                            assistance to fund his or her university education, the applicant must submit an
                            application for need-based financial aid. The vast majority of financial aid at LIUS
                            is given out in the form of need-based aid, and applicants should not rely on merit
                            scholarships to fund their University education.</p>
                        <p>You do not need a separate application to be considered for these scholarships. Your
                            admissions application will be reviewed based on academic performance, strength of
                            high-school curriculum, and standardized testing. Please keep in mind that many of
                            our applicants meet the minimum scholarship criteria; therefore, we are highly
                            selective within that pool.</p>
                        <p>All first-year applicants are automatically considered for merit scholarships; no
                            additional application is required. International transfer students are not eligible
                            for merit-based scholarships. Scholarship winners will receive notification of their
                            awards on a rolling basis through the end of April. Please note that only merit
                            scholarship winners are notified.</p>
                        <p>The number of international students awarded need-based aid from LIUS will depend on
                            the pool of applicants each year. Financial-aid forms must be submitted at the same
                            time as your admissions application for your application to be considered complete.
                            To apply for financial aid at LIUS, your family must complete a financial-aid
                            application.</p>
                        <p>International students may work on LIUS’ campus, subject to certain restrictions and
                            according to the terms of their visas.</p>
                        <p>Some departments provide their scholarships in the form of a monthly stipend that is
                            paid directly to the student receiving the award. Stipend payments are made monthly
                            according to the stipend schedule.</p>

                        <h4>Student Employment</h4>
                        <p>Student employment opportunities offer students a chance to gain valuable work
                            experience in addition to receiving a paycheck for their hours worked. Employment
                            positions are not assigned; students must initiate the job search and application
                            process. Wages earned from employment are not disbursed to your student account.
                            Instead they are earned by employment through the University and received as a
                            paycheck that can either be applied to the balance on your student account or be
                            used for living expenses.</p>
                        <ul class="list-marked list offset-top-10">
                            <li>On-campus work (not including Federal Work-Study).
                            </li>
                            <li>Off-campus work, with permission from the Office of International Services.
                                Please note
                                that off-campus work authorization is very limited.

                            <li>Private financing. In most cases, students will need to apply for financing with
                                a co-
                                borrower who is a credit-worthy Canadian citizen or Canadian permanent resident.
                            </li>

                        <h4>Outside Scholarships</h4>
                        <p>These funds may be available from sponsoring organizations including parents’
                            employers, religious organizations, fraternal societies, women’s clubs and
                            vocational rehabilitation funds. Information and advice regarding outside sources of
                            assistance can be obtained through high school guidance counselors, publications,
                            and the Internet.</p>
