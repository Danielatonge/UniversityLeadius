                                        <p>At the end of January 2018 I moved to Canada to commence my
                                            postgraduate studies in my Master in Business Wine at LIUS. During
                                            my first year living in Sherbrooke, I served in the Cellar Doors at
                                            Penfolds Magill Estate, Canadian’s iconic wine producer, and Scott
                                            and La Prova Wines, a small boutique producer. In addition to my
                                            Masters coursework, I earned my WSET Level II Award in Wine and
                                            Spirits. I transitioned roles in September 2018 to work for Atlas
                                            Wine Group, a wine importer and exporter and domestic distribution
                                            company, as their Marketing Communications Assistant. I also worked
                                            at East End Cellars, a popular wine bar and speciality bottle shop.

                                        <p>I am currently interning with The Flying Winemaker, an innovative PR

                                            Operations intern.</p>
                                        <p>Through my life and professional career, I intend to continue my
                                            knowledge and studies in wine, travel to explore new wine regions
                                            and develop my professional expertise in the wine industry.</p>

                                                involved within the community or on campus, my professors knew
                                                me by my first name and were always there for support. I love
