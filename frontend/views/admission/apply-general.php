                    <p>E-mail is one of the official means of communication between LIUS and its students. All students are
                        assigned a LIUS e-mail address upon course registration. The e-mail address assigned to a student by the
                        University will be the
                        only e-mail address used by LIUS for communication with students for academic and administrative
                        purposes. Students are
                        responsible for checking their LIUS e-mail account regularly so as to remain current with administrative
                        and academic
                        notifications. It is the student's responsibility to ensure that time- critical e-mail is accessed,
                        read, and acted upon in a timely
                        fashion. If a student chooses to forward University e-mail to another e-mail address, it is the
                        student‟s responsibility to ensure
                        that the alternate account
                        is active.</p>

                        <p>Applicants who have already graduated with an undergraduate degree are referred to as Special
                            Students. You will be considered for admission as a Special Students if you have a degree from an
                            accredited university that is equivalent to at least a 3 year Bachelor‟s Degree at LIUS and if you
                            have achieved a minimum overall average of 60% in the context of LIUS‟ grading system.</p>
                        <p>Admission to an undergraduate program does not imply acceptance into a graduate program. Special
                            Students who applied for graduate studies at LIUS, who were not admitted and were
                            recommended to take some undergraduate courses in order to improve their application for graduate
                            studies, are not guaranteed admission to an undergraduate program or course(s) at LIUS. These students
                            must follow the same application procedures and meet the same admission requirements as other
                            undergraduate applicants.</p>
                        <p>Students are not eligible to graduate with a degree from LIUS for a subject in which they have
                            already earned a degree. For example, an individual who applies to LIUS who already holds a degree in
                            biology from any university will not be eligible to graduate with a second degree in biology from
                            LIUS. However, he or she may be eligible to enroll in biology courses at LIUS for the purposes of
                            upgrading or supplementing previous education.</p>
                        <p>** LIUS reserves the right to cancel your application, withdraw a final offer of admission or revoke
                            registration if there is a discrepancy between the documents originally submitted and the official
                            final (updated) results submitted to WES for authentication and verification.</p>

                    <h3>Admission Requirements</h3>
                    <p>IFor admission purposes, LIUS will consider you under our Mature Student admission regulations if you:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list-marked list offset-top-10">
                        <li>Are a Canadian citizen or permanent resident at the time of application.

                            university or community college will be reviewed under those regulations).</li>

                </div>

                <p>Admission into first-year programs at LIUS is limited and competitive. Mature Students are normally
                    considered for part-time admission (i.e. a maximum of three full courses between September and April).
                    However, full-time enrollment may be necessary when preparing for admission to professional programs such
                    as Dentistry and Medicine.
                </p>
                <p>If you are applying for full-time admission, you must submit a Mature Applicant
                    Supplementary Form indicating why you feel you may be successful in university studies; what you wish to
                    gain from the experience; and why full-time admission is necessary. You should include information
                    relevant to your academic goals, career ambitions or plans, and past work experience. Part-time applicants
                    may also be required to submit similar documentation in support of their applications.</p>

                <p>Applicants who are 60 years of age may be considered for admission as a Senior Citizen. Students admitted
                    as a Senior Citizen may register in an undergraduate program on a full-time or part-time basis. Those
                    seeking admission to faculties other than Arts, Science, or Social Science may be required to provide
                    additional documentation. Admission to limited enrolment courses and programs is competitive and cannot be
                    guaranteed.</p>

                <h3>English Proficiency Requirements</h3>
                <p>At LIUS, admission consideration is based on academic qualifications along with evidence of English
                    proficiency for those applicants whose first language is not English. You must therefore submit proof of
                    English language proficiency before being considered for
                    admission.
                </p>
                <p>LIUS is an English language university and it is important to your success at LIUS that you are
                    proficient in both spoken and written English. All students must demonstrate the ability to speak and
                    write clearly and correctly. To encourage aptitude in the use of the English language, LIUS‟ instructors
                    consider proficiency in English when assigning grades. Work presented in English in any subject, at any
                    level, which shows a lack of proficiency in English may either be failed or, at the discretion of the
                    instructor, returned to the student for revision to a literate level.</p>
