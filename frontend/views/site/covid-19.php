                        <p>COVID-19 has affected people, communities, and organizations across the world. Like
                            everywhere else, campus life at the LIUS is different right now. All of us are
                            adapting to new ways of learning, connecting and communicating. Knowing what to
                            expect and where you can go for the information you need is an important first step.
                            We want to help you make the most of this new experience.</p>
                        <p>TLet’s be honest: 2020 has been a tough year. Amid a global pandemic whose rising
                            tide continues to take an enormous human and economic toll every day, it’s been hard
                            to hold out hope for whatever the ―new normal‖ might look like once COVID-19 finally
                            ebbs for good. But through everything—including academic and administrative
                            restructuring of unprecedented size and scope—the people of LIUS showed remarkable
                            resilience. Researchers opened doors of discovery, advanced innovative ideas and
                            revealed insights with far-reaching implications. Professors rapidly adapted to
                            teaching online to deliver the best educational experiences they could. Staff
                            co-ordinated an effective institution-wide public health response and kept the lines
                            of communication open even as they shifted to working remotely. Students showed deep
                            determination, overcame adversity and unlocked their incredible potential. And a
                            community united in shock and grief came together to remember and honour those we
                            suddenly lost.</p>
                        <p>Your first year of college presents a lot of new experiences: living away from home,
                            meeting new people and managing your own time. Prepare for life on campus by
                            figuring out what to bring, how to handle challenging circumstances and what you can
                            do to manage your workload.</p>

                        <h4>Policy Statement</h4>
                        <p>Because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the restrictions necessary to reduce the risk of
                            infection, LIUS has established layers of COVID-19 prevention measures to maintain
                            the safety of our campus community. Along with physical distancing, hand washing,
                            and education on prevention measures, LIUS has implemented an Interim Mask Policy.
                            This policy will outline the requirements of face masks on campus and applies to
                            faculty, staff, students, contractors, along with any visitors that periodically
                            come to campus property.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="offset-top-30">
                        <h4>Action</h4>
                        <p>All students, staff, faculty, contractors and visitors must have a face mask with
                            them at all times while on campus.</p>
                        <ol class="list list-ordered text-left">
                            <li><span>Face masks must be worn by all students, staff and faculty in all
                                    classrooms and commonly accessible shared indoor spaces on campus as well as
                                    within University vehicles.</span></li>
                            <li><span>Face masks must be worn by all students, staff and faculty in all
                                    classrooms and commonly accessible shared indoor spaces on campus as well as
                                    within University vehicles.</span></li>
                            <li><span>Face coverings must be worn covering the mouth and nose.</span></li>
                            <li><span>Professors have the option of removing their face mask for the duration of
                                    their lecture.
                                    The face mask must be secured appropriately prior to, and after the lecture
                                    is complete, as well as when speaking with a student. At the professor’s
                                    discretion, face masks may be removed when there is a hinderance to
                                    understanding, as long as a 2 metre (6ft) distance can be maintained. A face
                                    shield is recommended for the Professor to wear during their lecture, if
                                    they choose not to wear a face mask during that time. A face shield will be
                                    supplied by the university through the Safety and Security
                                    department.</span></li>
                            <li><span>Face masks may be removed for exercise, eating, while working alone in an
                                    office, within a residence room, designated student study spaces, or while
                                    outdoors if physical distancing can be maintained.
                                </span></li>
                            <li><span>One-way filter valve masks, clear plastic masks (such as a Mingle masks),
                                    and neck Gaiter Masks (Neck Gaiters), are not effective at filtering
                                    aerosols, and therefore, are not effective at protecting others from the
                                    spread of COVID-19. As a result, these types of masks will not be considered
                                    as an appropriate face mask while on the LIUS campus.</span></li>
                            <li><span>Cloth face masks should be washed and fully dried after each day’s wear.
                                    Appropriate cleaning of the face mask is the responsibility of the
                                    individual.</span></li>
                            <li><span>The wearing of masks will be monitored by Safety and Security and those
                                    individuals that violate this policy may be subject to disciplinary action
                                    and potentially, subsequent charges under the Nova Scotia Emergency
                                    Management Act.</span></li>
