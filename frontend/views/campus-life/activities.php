                        <p>A lot of what you learn at LIUS will take place outside the classroom. We encourage
                            you to participate in clubs and societies to meet people, play your favorite sports,
                            explore new hobbies, and help serve the community. We offer over 80 clubs and
                            societies grouped into three categories. You can also apply to create your own club
                            or society, which provides benefits in funding, booking space, and more.</p>

                            and to
                            network with other students. Students are also creating new academic clubs around
                            subjects
                            that are not formally taught at LIUS.</p>

                            league, which typically culminates with a championship. This level includes
                            regional, provincial, or national competition. High Performance Club Sports
                            train at a high level and have winning objectives.</p>

                            occasionally at recognized competitions. These clubs attend, and may organize or

                        <h4>Blue and Gold Crew</h4>
                        <p>The Blue and Gold Crew promote safe, social, and healthy consumption of alcohol.
                            Students in the Blue and Gold Crew encourage others to have a healthy relationship
                            with alcohol. We try to reduce the harms associated with alcohol including
                            over-intoxication, alcohol poisoning, hangovers, poor decisions, and death. These
                            harms are addressed via crisis intervention and improving education and
                            self-monitoring on alcohol consumption.</p>
                        <h6>Goals</h6>
                        <ul class="list-marked list offset-top-10">
                            <li><b>Take care of each other.</b> Promote prosocial bystander intervention to the
                                point where
                                all students at LIUS are watching each others’ backs and willing to help one
                                another
                                while consuming and during alcohol-related incidents.</li>
                            <li>Change the culture. Alter university drinking culture into a more social and
                                healthy
                                norm of behaviour. We want a community where those who wish to consume alcohol
                                can enjoy its positive effects without compromising the health, well-being,
                                dignity, or safety of themselves or others.</li>
                            <li>Spread the message. Grow our initiative throughout the campus community so that
                                the majority of students are either Blue Crew members or associated with at
                                least one member.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The Red and Blue and Gold Crew began as the Gold Watch Band program following the
                            tragic death of a student due to alcohol poisoning. The mother of the student
                            founded the program in the hopes of creating a community of students that would look
                            out for each other, so that help could be provided to those who might need it when
                            drinking.</p>
                        <h6>What We Do</h6>
                        <p>Blue and Gold Crew members do not have specific duties. No one is ever on shift, or
                            on call, or otherwise working for the University. However, it is expected that
                            members try to help other students who have drank unsafely or drank too much
                            alcohol.</p>
                        <p>Blue and Gold Crew members are expected to be prosocial bystanders, education
                            providers, and sometimes first responders to alcohol-related crises. Above all, the
                            goal is to teach students how to look after themselves when drinking while still
                            showing that help is available if things go wrong.</p>
                        <p>Members are not expected to help by themselves: waving over a bouncer ensures that
                            someone is attending to the situation, and that may be the extent of the help
                            provided by the member. The main point is making sure that there is someone with the
                            person that is unwell.</p>

                        <h6>Training</h6>
                        <p>Blue and Gold Crew conferences are held once a month to provide training and
                            information to students interested in becoming a part of the organization.</p>
                        <p>Conferences are held in the morning and are typically 2-3 hours. After the
                            conference, attendees will be presented with a Blue and Gold Crew band and will be
                            sent a certificate acknowledging their participation.</p>
                        <p>Training is focused on crisis intervention and prevention, and on creating an
                            attitude of helping others in need. Blue and Gold Crew training is not a substitute
                            for proper medical training or first aid, as members will not be expected to aid
                            others on their own but to find trained help when it is needed.</p>
