                        <p>...just remember that the use of alcohol and drugs do not have to be a part of these
                            experiences. Some students choose to drink or smoke, and many choose not to.
                            Whatever you choose, remember to keep it social.
                        </p>
                        <p>LIUS recognizes that access to substances for consumption (alcohol, cannabis, and
                            other legal or illegal drugs) is a part of everyday life, but we view this from a
                            perspective of wellness and harms reduction. We use all opportunities to share
                            information about how attitudes, behaviours, indicators, and protective strategies
                            can help students navigate a culture of substance use in a positive way.</p>
                        <p>The most important things you need to know are:</p>

                        <ul class="list-marked list offset-top-10">
                            <li>You must be age 19 or older to consume alcohol, cannabis, or tobacco.</li>
                            <li>LIUS is a smoke-free campus. You cannot use e-cigarettes, cannabis, and
                                waterpipes.</li>
                            <li>Open alcohol is not permitted on campus grounds. When you transport alcohol, it
                                must remain unopened.</li>
                            <li>When you are on campus, you should be prepared to provide identification at any
                                time.</li>
                            <li>You can have a good time without alcohol or drugs.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>We encourage you to familiarize yourself with the university's official policy. We
                            expect you to:</p>

                                cannabis and ensure they are not subject to possible harms from the actions of
                                any individuals

                        <p>Spirituality can include the celebration of a person’s identity and cultivation of
                            one’s fullest potential. Other dimensions of spirituality may include pursuing depth
                            and fulfillment in relationships with others; fostering links to nature and all that
                            exists in the universe; making an effort to connect with God/Higher Power;
                            integrating the spiritual quest with academic development; exercising agency to
                            overcome adversity and have hope; resolving to contribute to making the world a
                            better place.</p>
                        <h4>Spiritual Wellness</h4>
                        <p>For many of us, spiritual wellness is an important part of our mental health and
                            overall well- being. Spiritual Wellness can be explored via organized religion or
                            other paths, activities and beliefs that give us a sense of purpose and meaning.</p>
                        <h4>Manning Memorial Chapel</h4>
                        <p>The Manning Memorial Chapel is the spiritual heart of LIUS. Over years, students
                            sought a prayer space and championed its construction. To this day, students
                            continue to be the driving force behind spirituality on campus. We aim to meet the
                            needs of today’s students, including those of different faiths; and those with no
                            faith commitment, who are curious about religion and spirituality. The Chapel
                            facilitates interfaith awareness, dialogue and action.</p>
                        <p>The Chapel is an inclusive place that hosts both secular and non-secular groups. Non-
                            Christian faiths are welcome to use the facility for worship or events. The Chapel
                            is home to a variety of events gatherings. Many students appreciate using its quiet
                            spaces to reflect or even to study. The Chapel is open from 6am to 10pm every day of
                            the year.</p>

                        <h4>Our Chaplain</h4>
                        <p>LIUS’ Chaplain conducts Christian worship services that are ecumenical, Protestant,
                            inclusive and affirming. Other resources are provided for prayer and meditation;
                            individual and group spiritual care; and for retreats, Bible studies and meditation
                            experiences in virtual and face to face experiences.</p>
                        <h4>The Chapel Choir</h4>
                        <p>The Chapel Choir is comprised of approximately 24 persons. The Choir is famous for
                            its moving leadership of congregational singing and inspiring choral presentations
                            during worship services. The Choir also gives performances at the Chapel as well as
                            venues within and beyond Sherbrooke.</p>
